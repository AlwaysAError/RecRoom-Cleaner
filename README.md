# RecRoom-Spoofer
A Batch script which will clean your RecRoom install and will completely wipe EAC from your system.

This Batch script will help you with spoofing in RecRoom. The script will delete all of RecRoom's tracking file's converting your RecRoom install back to default. This script also comes with IP and DNS cleaning tools, EAC wiping tools, a RecRoom uninstaller and HWID checking commands. This is V1 of the script as I am planning on adding more in the future.

How to set up!
1 Download all given file's
2 Create a folder anywhere you like (desktop is the best place)
3 Put all the downloaded file's into the folder you just created
4 Run the shortcut and then wait for the script to launch
5 Select the option you want to use in the given script!
Boom! That's how easy it is.

Commands To Spoof RecRoom
If you want to spoof RecRoom you will need to run:
"Clean RecRoom"
"Clean Your IP And DNS"
"Uninstall And Clean EAC"
Don't forgot you will need a HWID spoofer to!

HWID's Which Need To Be Changed Or Spoofed:
MAC Address (You can use SMAC)
System Information (Serial Number + UUID) (DMIEDIT)
MotherBoard Serial Number (DMIEDIT)
System Enclosure/Chassis Serial Number (DMIEDIT)
CPU (Serial Number + Asset tag) (DMIEDIT)
